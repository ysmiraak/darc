** train tokenizers and taggers with [[https://github.com/ufal/udpipe][udpipe]]

   and run on the gold standard =train= to produce =silver-train=:
   
   we used the =(detokenized-)baselinemodel-splits=, but took both =train= and
   =tune= for =train=, and =dev= for =tune=. and we used the same parameters as
   the baseline models.

** train embeddings with [[https://github.com/wlin12/wang2vec][wang2vec]]
