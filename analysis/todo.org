* architecture

- max-norm on embeddings

- max-norm on hidden

- two hidden layers

- with full deprel

* silver training

- run udpipe tagger on gold-train to produce silver-train

- pretrain embeddings on silver-train: 32 dim form 32 dim lemma; 64 dim form for
  =ug=, =en_lines=, =sv_lines=, =id=, =pt_br=, =ko=

- make setups from silver-train and embeddings (tune proj)

- make models from setups and save them with the necessary data from setups

- finally test.conllu -> udpipe model -> darc model

* troubles

- surprise languages
